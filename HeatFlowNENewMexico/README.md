Solution for crustal geotherm underneath northeastern New Mexico. (103.5W, 36N).
Solution is constrained by surface heat flux and temperature measurements, and mantle heat flux estimate.
Crustal base temperature is constrained to 600C, melting point for mafic rocks. 
Solution is described mathematically in HEATODE.pdf. Script ODEHeat.py computes solution.
